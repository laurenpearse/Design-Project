# Micro-Mouse Power Module Design

This repository contains the power subsystem design files for the Micro-Mouse project, developed by **Emma Neill (NLLEMM002)** and **Lauren Pearse (PRSLAU006)** as part of the EEE3088F Design Project at the University of Cape Town.

## Purpose

This repository was created to:

- Upload and version-control the **KiCad schematic and PCB layout files**
- Allow both contributors to **collaborate remotely and take turns editing** the project
- Keep a record of design iterations and updates throughout development
